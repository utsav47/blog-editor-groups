Css Rotation</h1><div><div>Although it is not technically necessary to follow the last declaration of a rule with a semicolon, it is generally good practice to do so. First, it will keep you in the habit of terminating your declarations with semicolons, the lack of which is one of the most common causes of rendering errors. Second, if you decide to add another declaration to a rule, you won’t have to worry about forgetting to insert an extra semicolon. Finally, some older browsers such as Internet Explorer 3.x have a greater tendency to become confused if the semicolon is left off the final declaration in a rule. Avoid all these problems—always follow a declaration with a semicolon, wherever the rule appears.</div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><h1 class="w">Grouping Everything</h1><p class="w">You now know that you can group selectors, and you can group declarations. By combining both kinds of grouping in single rules, you can define very complex styles using only a few statements. Now, what if you want to assign some complex styles to all the headings in a document, and you want the same styles to be applied to all of them? Here’s how to do it

Class Selectors</h1><div><div>So far, we’ve been grouping selectors and declarations together in a variety of ways, but the selectors we’ve been using are still simple ones that refer only to document elements. They’re fine up to a point, but there are times when you need something a little more specialized.</div><div>In addition to raw document elements, there are two other types of selectors: class selectors and ID selectors, which let you assign styles in a way that is independent of document elements. These selectors can be used on their own or in conjunction with element selectors. However, they work only if you’ve marked up your document appropriately, so using them generally involves a little forethought and planning. For example, say you’re drafting a document that discusses ways of handling plutonium. The document contains various warnings about safely dealing with such a dangerous substance. You want each warning to appear in boldface text so that it will stand out. However, you don’t know which elements these warnings will be. Some warnings could be entire paragraphs, while others could be a single item within a lengthy list or a small section of text. So, you can’t define a rule using simple selectors of any kind. Suppose you tried this route</div></div>
